00:01:33.075 --> 00:01:39.277
Hello, welcome to Jam Jews beginner guitar.
My name is Ethan Michael and I will be your instructor.

2
00:01:39.778 --> 00:01:43.531
In this lesson we will discuss what to expect to learn from this course,

3
00:01:43.781 --> 00:01:47.466
And we’re also going to touch on the role of instruments in Jewish spiritual life.

4
00:01:47.966 --> 00:01:49.967
We will practice holding and
strumming the guitar,

5
00:01:50.467 --> 00:01:52.009
I’ll show you how to tune your instrument

6
00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.218
And we’ll go over some simple practice techniques.

7
00:01:55.468 --> 00:01:59.964
Subsequent lessons will involve
much less talking and more playing.

8
00:02:00.064 --> 00:02:02.564
Before we get started I just want to
introduce myself

9
00:02:02.733 --> 00:02:03.985
I’m Ethan Michael

10
00:02:04.731 --> 00:02:06.982
and I’ve been playing the guitar
since I was 10 years old

11
00:02:07.486 --> 00:02:10.984
And I’m in a number of bands
including a rock ‘n’ roll band,

12
00:02:11.237 --> 00:02:14.710
A funk band, and most recently
a surf rock band.

13
00:02:15.311 --> 00:02:17.413
I study music at the University of Denver

14
00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:21.411
and I got a focus on jazz guitar,

15
00:02:22.001 --> 00:02:24.003
and for me music has always been special

16
00:02:24.337 --> 00:02:27.335
some of my earliest memories have
been watching concert DVDs or

17
00:02:28.588 --> 00:02:29.843
listening to CDs in the car.

18
00:02:30.343 --> 00:02:33.840
As I grew up and pursued the guitar as a craft,

19
00:02:34.092 --> 00:02:37.009
my appreciation for music has only deepened,

20
00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:41.591
so much so that it’s difficult
to put into words
how music has changed my life.

21
00:02:42.186 --> 00:02:44.190
In addition to teaching you the guitar
in this course

22
00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:46.687
I hope to deepen and strengthen
your appreciation

23
00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:50.938
and love for the music as we progress
through this course together.

24
00:02:51.937 --> 00:02:53.438
Before I got involved with Jam Jews

25
00:02:54.189 --> 00:02:57.180
I didn’t have a deep relationship
with my Jewish roots.

26
00:03:02.294 --> 00:03:06.710
I look forward to continuing my own
exploration of Jewish
communal music with all of you.

27
00:03:07.461 --> 00:03:10.960
Some of the songs in this course are classics
and some are brand new.

28
00:03:11.213 --> 00:03:13.733
Since the music covered in guitar
learning courses

29
00:03:13.814 --> 00:03:16.541
tend to feature a lot of music
written by sis-gender men,

30
00:03:17.029 --> 00:03:21.208
We felt it was important to feature
music written not just by sis-gendered men.

31
00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:25.232
In this course he will learn songs
by composers such as Batya Levine,

32
00:03:25.984 --> 00:03:28.481
Coleen Dieker, Josh Warshawsky,

33
00:03:28.987 --> 00:03:32.986
Dr. Koach Baruch Frazier, Deborah Sacks Mintz,

34
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.900
Rabbi Yosef Goldman, Eliana Light,
And many more great songwriters.
